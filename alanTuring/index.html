    <p>10 facts about Alan Turing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1926, at the age of 13, Turing began attending classes at Sherborne School in the town of Dorset. It was there that he revealed his incredible skill in science and mathematics. Even though he had never studied calculus in elementary school, he revealed his ability to solve advanced problems while he was at Sherborne School.</li>
      <li>For a period of time during the Second World War, Turing spearheaded a section of Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. This section was known as Hut 8, and its main objective was breaking Enigma codes within the German navy. Turing was eventually replaced by his deputy, Hugh Alexander, in 1942, who was himself succeeded by Patrick Mahon in 1944.</li>
      <li>Turing didn’t wait until the Second World War to start changing the world. As far back as 1936, when Turing was a student at Princeton University, he discussed an idea he had of a device “capable of resolving any problem that could be described by simple instructions.” This ‘Turing Machine,’ as it was called, became the groundworks for what we know today as the modern computer.</li>
      <li>Once a year, a chosen speaker gives a lecture on the subject of computer science. This lecture, co-hosted by the British Computer Society and the Institution of Engineering and Technology, has been held in such places as the University of Glasgow, London’s Royal Institution, and Belfast City Hall. In honor of Turing, it is called the Turing Lecture.</li>
      <li>Contrary to a claim made in The Imitation Game, Turing did not name the first Bombe machine “Christopher” after his lost love from school. It was given the nickname “Victory.”</li>
      <li>In 1950, Turing created a test to measure artificial intelligence in machines. Turing didn’t believe in associating genuine thoughts with machines, arguing instead that it was better to gauge how well a machine could imitate human behavior, and thus persuade people that it isn’t a machine.</li>
      <li>In 1966, the Turing Awards were introduced. These awards are given annually to celebrate contributions to the world of computing. We can only assume how many Bill Gates or Steve Wozniak have earned in their lifetimes!</li>
      <li>In 1941, Turing proposed to Joan Clarke, a mathematician and cryptologist who worked with Turing in Hut 8. However, Turing felt he couldn’t go through with marrying Clarke due to his sexual orientation. After coming out to Clarke, the engagement was called off.</li>
      <li>In 1952, Turing and Arnold Murray were charged with “gross indecency” after Turing was forced to admit that he and Murray were in a sexual relationship. This admission meant that they were guilty of violating a law that made gay relationships illegal. Turing was persuaded to enter a guilty plea rather than fight the charges, and was given the choice of imprisonment or probation, during which time he would have to accept hormonal treatment to reduce his libido—in other words, he was chemically castrated.</li>
      <li>On June 8, 1954, Turing’s body was found in his home, having died the day before, alongside a half-eaten apple. The cause of death was determined to be cyanide poisoning, and an inquest ruled that Turing had taken his own life. It was a tragic way for such a hero to die.</li>
    <br><i>"There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world."</i>
